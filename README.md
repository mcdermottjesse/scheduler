# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a modern single page client application built using the React view library where users are able to book, edit and cancel interviews for different days of the week. If a interview is saved or deleted the number of spots will increase or decrease accordingly. 

As well as React, the application combines a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience. Interview Scheduler implements a PostgreSQL database which is persisted by the API server. Axios is used to make HTTP requests and various testing Frameworks are implemented including Storybook, Jest, Testing Library and Cypress.
